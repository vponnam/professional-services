# Custom Role Analyzer
 
While working with custom roles once created it is hard to find out if those roles are based out of any of the predefined roles.
In custom roles you will see a set of permissions as it is possible that many roles have common permissions.
 
This tool will provide useful insights with respect to custom roles at organization level as well as project level.
It will print results in file which contains following fields:
1. Custom Role - Name of the custom role.
2. Parent - Parent of the custom role. It can be an organization or project.
3. List of predefined roles - List of predefined roles by which this custom role is made of.
4. Additional permissions required - Any additional permission apart from predefined roles we need to rebuild this custom role.
5. No of additional permissions - Total number of additional permissions required to rebuild this custom role.
6. No of original permissions - Total number of permissions originally this custom role has.
7. Is Exact Match - If this custom role matches exactly to 1 or more predefined roles then it is set to True otherwise false.

It provides results in CSV or JSON format. Default is CSV.

 
# Getting Started
 
## Requirements:
* Java 11
* Maven 3
* GCP roles - roles/iam.organizationRoleViewer and roles/resourcemanager.folderViewer at org level.
* APIs to enable - `Cloud Resource Manager API` needs to be enabled for the project from which the service account is created.
 
Please set `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<service-account.json>` before executing `analyze.sh` script.
 
 
 
## Building the Project
Build and package the entire project using the maven package command.
 
```
mvn clean install
```
 
This will create an executable jar inside the `target` folder which will be used from the `analyze.sh` script.
 
## Running the tool
Run following command:
```
analyze.sh -o <org_id> -f <format>
```
Parameters: \
-o --org       : GCP Organization Id (mandatory parameter). \
-f --format    : Result format (optional parameter; defaults to csv and supports json).
 
You can simply run as follows to get default format:
 
```
analyze.sh -o <org_id>
```
## Assumptions
* It is assumed that custom role does not have any "TESTING" stage permissions. If it does then those will be shows as `Additional permissions required` column in the result and `Is Exact Match` will be set to false.
